## Tech Stack

Using Typescript on both ends of the project with Tailwind styling the front and Express delivering from the back. Using Pugjs as express' view engine
and MongoDB as the database for the information

## What I Learned
Getting a better handle using Typescript and the quirks that come with it. I'm getting a better understanding for how HTTP methods work and how to use them
in the back end to send and recieve data. Learning more about MongoDB, how to shape the data for efficient retreival and manipulate that data from within the server.

## Optimizations/TODO

- Add loggin
- Add TailWind for CSS
- Add handler for UPDATE method
- Add handler for PUT method
- Fix GET method to bring back data from MongoDB
- Populate data
- Host application
- Add picture/demo to README.md
